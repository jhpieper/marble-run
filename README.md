A collection of marble run tracks that mount onto any magnetic surface.  
Make it your own by deciding which parts to print or even customizing them using the included openscad files!

## The Tracks
### Straight
Just a straight run. Available in many lengths from 50mm to 200mm.
### Curve
A 90 degree curved piece.  Great to catch a falling ball and getting it onto the next track.
### The Drop
A classic way to drop the ball onto the next track.
Spin it as the ball goes past.  Can be used to launch another ball that is stored in.
### The Wheel
Spins as the ball goes past.  Get creative and use it to launch another ball that is stored in the wheel.  Or kick a ball placed on a track above into action.

Available in various sizes and blade counts.  Some assembly required: wheel-\<-size\>-\<bladecount\> + wheel-base + lock-\<style\>.

Customize the look by using different colors for the parts.
### The Pole
Catch a ball and vault it to the next track.

Assemble pole-\<left|right\> + pole-base + lock-\<style\>

Customize the look by using different colors for the parts.
### The Whirlpool!
The ball goes in circles until it drops through the center.  Mount level for best effect.
