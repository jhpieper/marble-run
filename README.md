# Marble Run
3D printable magnetic marble run modeled in openSCAD.

![Our marble run](/images/marble-run1.jpg)

A collection of marble run tracks that mount onto any magnetic surface.  
Make it your own by deciding which parts to print or even customizing them using the included openscad files!

## The Tracks
<table border=0 padding=3 width=100%>
<tr><td valign="top">

<h3>Straight</h3>
Just a straight run. Available in many lengths from 50mm to 200mm.
</td><td width=230px align="center">

</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">

<h3>The Wave</h3>
This track makes things a bit more interesting. Print with supports.
</td><td align="center">
<img width="195" src="/images/wave.jpg">
</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">

<h3>Curve</h3>
A 90 degree curved piece.  Great to catch a falling ball and getting it onto the next track.
</td><td align="center">

</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">

<h3>The Tunnel</h3>
A straight pipe that hides the ball.  Available in multiple lengths.

<h3>The Drop</h3>
A classic way to drop the ball onto the next track.

</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">

<h3>Lombard Street</h3>
A San Franciso landmark for your marble.  Print with supports.
</td><td align="center">
<img width="195" src="/images/lombard-street.jpg">  
</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">

<h3>The Wheel</h3>
Spins as the ball goes past.  Get creative and use it to launch another ball that is stored in the wheel.  Or kick a ball placed on a track above into action.

Available in various sizes and blade counts.  Some assembly required: wheel-\<-size\>-\<bladecount\> + wheel-base + lock-\<style\>.

Customize the look by using different colors for the parts.
</td><td align="center">
<img width="195" src="/images/wheel.jpg">  
</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">

<h3>The Pole</h3>
Catch a ball and vault it to the next track.

Assemble pole-\<left|right\> + pole-base + lock-\<style\>

Customize the look by using different colors for the parts.

The picture shows several design iterations.
</td><td align="center">

<h3>The Whirlpool!</h3>
The ball goes in circles until it drops through the center.  Mount level for best effect.
</td><td align="center">
<img width="195" src="/images/whirlpool.jpg">  
</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">

<h3>The Looping</h3>
This one is tricky!  Mount it at the right angle, extend the incoming ramp and the marble will
successfully perform a looping.

</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">

<h3>Funnel</h3>
It's a funnel. 
</td><td align="center">
<img width="195" src="/images/funnel.jpg">
</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">

<h3>Flipflop</h3>
The flipflop diverts the marble left or right. 

Assemble flipflop + flipflop-base + lock-\<style\>
</td><td align="center">
<img width="195" src="/images/flipflop.jpg">
</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">

<h3>Tray</h3>
The tray is a great way to finish the run and to store extra marbles.

## Magnets
All tracks are designed for round 10mm x 2mm magnets.  
They can easily be ordered from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0753ZPBLQ/) or other retailers.

Each track needs at least two magnets, but many require three or even more.

The mounting holes were initially designed to be tight enough to just push the magnets in, 
but that turned out to be problematic.  It was difficult to get the magnets to be flat rather than pivoting.  Magnets would regularly fall out, etc.

In the end I switched to securing the magnets with hot glue.  The holes are slightly wider to easily allow the magnet to be pushed into the glue.  Hot glue is also excellent to make the back of the track less smooth if tracks slide on the board when marbles pass.  Just spread a thin layer of hotglue all along the back and let it cool.  The resulting surface has a nice grip.
