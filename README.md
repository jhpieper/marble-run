A collection of marble run tracks that mount onto any magnetic surface.  
Make it your own by deciding which parts to print or even customizing them using the included openscad files!

## The Tracks
### Straight
<p>
<img align="left" height=100 src="/images/straight.jpg">
Just a straight run. Available in many lengths from 50mm to 200mm.
</p>

### Curve
<p>
<img align="left" height=100 src="/images/curve.jpg">  
A 90 degree curved piece.  Great to catch a falling ball and getting it onto the next track.
</p>

### The Drop
<p>
<img align="left" height=100 src="/images/drop.jpg">  
A classic way to drop the ball onto the next track.
Spin it as the ball goes past.  Can be used to launch another ball that is stored in.
</p>

### The Wheel
<p>
<img align="left" height=100 src="/images/wheel.jpg">  
Spins as the ball goes past.  Get creative and use it to launch another ball that is stored in the wheel.  Or kick a ball placed on a track above into action.

Available in various sizes and blade counts.  Some assembly required: wheel-\<-size\>-\<bladecount\> + wheel-base + lock-\<style\>.

Customize the look by using different colors for the parts.
</p>

### The Pole
Catch a ball and vault it to the next track.

Assemble pole-\<left|right\> + pole-base + lock-\<style\>

Customize the look by using different colors for the parts.

### The Whirlpool!
The ball goes in circles until it drops through the center.  Mount level for best effect.

## More to come!
We are planning to add more tracks to the collection.  Here are a few things we are already working on:
* funnel
* goal (ball storage)
* diverter
* looping
* zig-zag track
