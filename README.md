A collection of marble run tracks that mount onto any magnetic surface.  
Make it your own by deciding which parts to print or even customizing them using the included openscad files!

<h3>The Drop</h3>
A classic way to drop the ball onto the next track.
Spin it as the ball goes past.  Can be used to launch another ball that is stored in.

</td></tr><tr><td>
<h3>The Wheel</h3>
Spins as the ball goes past.  Get creative and use it to launch another ball that is stored in the wheel.  Or kick a ball placed on a track above into action.

Available in various sizes and blade counts.  Some assembly required: wheel-\<-size\>-\<bladecount\> + wheel-base + lock-\<style\>.

Customize the look by using different colors for the parts.
